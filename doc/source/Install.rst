Installing
==========

This code is not yet complete.  As such, proper install files have not been created.  Therefore, you are on your own and should consider contacting the author, Brian Schmidt: bps10 at u dot washington dot edu

Eventually you will be able to use commands such as::

   python setup.py build
   python setup.py install  
 
For now you will have to clone the repository using::

   git clone https://github.com/bps10/

The following dependencies should automatically be installed via ``easy_install`` or ``pip``, provided these programs are installed.
