This module was originally built to process physiology data from Rieke lab mex files.
It will continue to be updated for some time to reflect the current demands.

Currently adapting it to also display images.

Should read pytables code for inspiration.

Eventually may move some of this onto `AWS <https://aws.amazon.com>`_
