This module has been built to process physiology data from Rieke lab mex files.

Currently adapting it to also display images.

Should read pytables code for inspiration.

**Need a query system!**

.. todo::
   * Add a signin feature.
   * Add name of person who makes changes to database - include with git?.
   * Pause database during input.
   * Dump function - ASCII ? Mike was interested.
   * Develop QUERY system. Create Epoch groups
   * Tabs for each open database using QTabWidget with QTreeWidget.
